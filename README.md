## About Me
- Passionate programmer, mostly coding in **C++** (working toward my own standards).  
- Also experienced in **C#** and **Java**, with occasional dives into **C**.  
- Currently experimenting with a **custom shell in C++ (GUI)** (might come... or not 👀).  

## Projects
- **GUI++ (C++)** – Making a programming language to make nice GUIs using **SDL2** and **C++** as backend (Still in progress).

## What I Like About C++

- Control over memory and performance  
- The satisfaction of making it compile
- Flexing on JS developers

## What I Hate About C++
